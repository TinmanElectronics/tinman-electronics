## Design considerations

I'm a firm believer of the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, so
I've designed this website to be as simple and portable as I can make
it. Much of my inspiration for designing a simple website came from
[Eric S. Raymond's website](http://www.catb.org/esr/site-design.html).
One of the things that piqued my interest with Eric's website was his
compliance with the
["Viewable With Any Browser" campaign](http://www.anybrowser.org/campaign/).
I take special measures to keep this website accessible on all
browsers.

## Contributing

This website is one of my [babies] projects, so I'm inclined to
improve it. If you think of any great ideas, by all means contact me!
Any suggestions on how I can improve it would be appreciated.

Here are some example areas that could use help:

* Spelling/typos
* Fixing broken links
* Designing for portability

Here are a few reasonable ways you can take action:

* Email me. jstamant@tinmanelectronics.com
* Make changes yourself. If you file a pull request, I'll take a look
  at it.
* Send me a screenshot of your browser window. Gives me a good
  reference for other screen sizes.
