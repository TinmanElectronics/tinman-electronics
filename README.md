# TinmanElectronics.com

This is the website repository for **http://tinmanelectronics.com**

## Design considerations

I need my website to be viewable across all platforms. Any suggestions on how I can improve will be appreciated. It would also help if you included screenshots of your own browser window for reference.

## Contributing

This website is one of my [babies] projects, so I'm inclined to improve it. If you think of any great ideas, by all means contact me! Here are some example areas that could use help:

* Spelling/typos
* Fixing broken links
* Designing for portability

Here are a few reasonable ways you can take action:

* Email me. jstamant@tinmanelectronics.com
* Make changes yourself. If you file a pull request, I'll take a look at it.

Under normal circumstances, I would release this project under a copyleft license to support my open-source beliefs; but I don't see this project being useful as a derivative. Maybe a beginner web-programmer might enjoy seeing the way I've done it.
