## About Tinman Electronics (page under construction)

I'm willing to offer my services anywhere that my interests lie. My early years in technology were heavily influenced by Eric S. Raymond's ["How To Become A Hacker"](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html), and just like a hacker, I enjoy a good problem to solve.

### Website design

I've designed this website to be as simple and portable as I can make it. A lot of my inspiration for designing a simple website came from [Eric S. Raymond's website](http://www.catb.org/esr/site-design.html), and so I try to keep this website accessible on any browser as part of the ["Viewable With Any Browser" campaign](http://www.anybrowser.org/campaign/).
