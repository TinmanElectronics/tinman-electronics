TEMP Lead-free solder. Although highly frowned upon by soldering practitioners, I give the bane of electronics manufacturing a shot. I acquired some of this nasty stuff from the Elenco power supply I built in a previous episode, and I might as well enrich our knowledge by trying it at least once.

Turns out I didn't entirely hate using it. There must have been less flux in the core as my usual solder, because this stuff laid on pretty thick. It was indeed harder to use, but it's nothing an experienced tech can't handle.
