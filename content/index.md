## Welcome to Tinman Electronics!

This website is a collection of my electronics engineering
projects. You'll find fully documented projects, notes, research,
journal entries, engineering tips,...you name it!

I do electronics engineering on my own time. Like...for
fun. Everything I do, I stuff under the umbrella of Tinman Electronics
in hopes of one day turning this into a profitable business.

...But until then, this is technically an elaborate joke.
