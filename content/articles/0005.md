I've had this Line 6 Spider II amp head kicking around the lab for a while. I finally decide to troubleshoot it so I can get it out of the way! I'm no audio equipment guru, but when it comes to audio circuits, I can handle myself.

Here's the block diagram I came up with for the audio front-end, and the amplifier's interface.

There are quite a few neat little ICs on this DSP board. The first would be the external ADC chip, the TLC542. 11 channels of 8-bit quantization, available to you in an interface similar to SPI. The chip is quite costly at ~$5. Gotta love A/D!

The next most interesting chip is the AK4528 audio CODEC chip. Check out its datasheet. This IC performs high-resolution ADC and DAC functions with a 96KHz bandwidth. This one runs for ~$8. I wonder if this is a cheap alternative to digital audio I/O. I wouldn't know.

Another hot chip I briefly refer to as the "stereo amplifier chip" is the TPA6111A2 stereo audio power amplifier. It's just a dual op-amp chip designed for 150mW power output into a 16<span style="color: #000000;"> ohm load.</span>');
