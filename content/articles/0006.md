This one is more successful than last week's episode. Behold! <a href="http://youtu.be/DsnTLj2F2SE">http://youtu.be/DsnTLj2F2SE</a>

The Fender Hot Rod Deluxe III is a loud little amp.  My friend never boosts the volume past 2, and was wondering if I could just curve that down a bit. I looked into it, found some service diagrams, and determined that I could do it without problem.

This is the schematic of the amp's front end.

I figured that the voltage out of the volume potentiometer was the controlling element for the volume, so I could increase R9 to reduce the maximum voltage coming out of the voltage divider.
