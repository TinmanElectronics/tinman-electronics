Title: How to print in multiple colors
Date: 2015/02/04

Before I give you the breakdown of this whole process, I'll mention that I made a video about this, and published a quick post for context. It's not meant to be as detailed as this article, but the concepts should suffice for the experienced hacker.

Here's the link to the post of the video <a href="http://tinmanelectronics.com/posts/te021/">http://tinmanelectronics.com/posts/te021/</a>

## Objectives

The main objective of this research is to find a working process to print in two colors.

I should speculate now that the process I found for printing in two colors is meant for printing whole layers in a single color. Printing multiple colors on the same layer would require significantly more manual work. I don't even know how this could be used to print multiple colors on the same layer, anyways!

--------------------------------------------------

## Test specifications

This method was only tested on my own 3D printer setup. I have a Mixshop Prusa i3 running Sprinter firmware. I use Pronterface as my host software, and Slic3r for generating my G-code.

--------------------------------------------------

## Steps

### 1. Slice your 3D model

Configure the slicing parameters as usual.

Now, turn on relative e-distances. You can locate it in the "Printer Settings" tab, check off the "Use relative E distances" check-box. This is required, or your printer will squirt a blob of filament upon resuming the print, which can be catastrophic.

Again under the "Printer Settings" tab, in the "Custom G-code" menu, you'll want to add some layer-change g-code.

`; LAYER [layer_num]`

Add that to the "Layer change G-code", it'll help you locate the layer on which you wish to swap filaments.

### 2. Modify G-code

find layer you wish to change color.

<a href="http://tinmanelectronics.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/shot04.png"><img src="http://tinmanelectronics.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/shot04.png" alt="shot04" width="1016" height="749" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-261" /></a>

Explain how to count up to your desired layer?

<a href="http://tinmanelectronics.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/shot05.png"><img src="http://tinmanelectronics.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/shot05.png" alt="shot05" width="1017" height="749" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-262" /></a>

Insert G-code before layer change (before ; LAYER X gcode)

<a href="http://tinmanelectronics.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/shot06.png"><img src="http://tinmanelectronics.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/shot06.png" alt="shot06" width="1016" height="749" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-263" /></a>

Save the file.

Any changes? Mention possibility to use absolute e-distances here? Or mention it before?

### 3. Run G-code

Load G-code.

Press print, try to be around when the print pauses.

What the printer does before pausing for good?

### 4. Change filament

ANY CONTROL CHANGES LIKE Z UP???

Pull out filament, push in new one until you can't push any further. It's a little tough, but the extruder isn't gripping it. I suggest that you ensure the extruder is primed, extrude 1 millimeter. Optional, you can move the extruder Z up to make more space for extruding. IS IT NECESSARY TO MOVE IT BACK DOWN?

WHAT DOES RELATIVE E-DISTANCES DO?

2 choices: clear extruder, or dont.

Press resume once ready. MOVE BACK TO POSITION Z DOWN???

### 5. FINISH PRINT?

--------------------------------------------------

The gcode snippet I used in the video worked, but upon resuming the print after the filament change, the printer would extrude a big blob of filament on the print. I suspect this was due to changing the extruder from absolute positioning to relative, and back again.

Although this isn't a perfect fix, you can use the following code to change your filament without a problem, but you're forced to use the "relative e-distances" setting in your slicing software.

```

;; description: gcode snippet that interrupts a print to allow filament swapping

;; notes:
;;  - for use with relative e-distances
;; tested: 29/03/2015 by Justin R. St-Amant
;; test specs:
;;  - Pronterface version 2014.08.01
;;  - Slic3r version 1.1.7

G1 E-1.00 F6000; retract filament
G1 Y0.00 F9000; move print away from the extruder
M84 E; disengage the extruder stepper motor from 'holding' position  
;@pause print
G28 X Y; home X and Y axis in case position was bumped out  
G1 E0 F6000; engage the extruder stepper motor
```

This was meant to be a copy-paste solution for 3D printer filament change, but you may be able to use this code with absolute e-distances as long as you tweak the values.
