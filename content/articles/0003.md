Title: Servo PWM and electrical input

This week you gotta check out part 2 of 3 from my servo motor series: <a style="color: #167ac6;" href="http://youtu.be/EpB53YZc3rs" target="_blank">http://youtu.be/EpB53YZc3rs</a>

In this episode, I visit the electrical input for servo motors and demonstrate that in action.

I may sound vain quoting myself here: "There's no reason why you shouldn't understand any of this." Seriously, though. I want everyone to know what PWM is about; especially when it comes to servo motors.

There's so many good resources on the internet about pulse-width modulation (PWM). It doesn't only apply to servo motors. PWM is simple: the signal level is proportional to the duty cycle of the PWM waveform. It's a little more complicated than that, but instead of whipping out the fancy words, I'll let the following figure do the talking.

That's the nature of PWM. The the decoded signal from a PWM-encoded signal is simply the average of the whole waveform.

That's engineering.
