      I'm afraid this page is unpopulated at the moment! But I have plans. Ambitions, even! That's engineering!

      I'll be listing my projects here, however small or large. I have an interest in properly engineering my projects, and documenting them well, too...But sometimes, you just have to hack something fast in the name of research. I like to keep a nice balance of small and large projects.
